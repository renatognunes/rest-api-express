This project uses technologies such as JavaScript ES6, Node.js, NPM, SQL, Sequelize.js ORM, and Express web framework. I've built a REST API for users to administer a school database. The API allows users to create an account, create, update and delete courses. The API also provides a list of all courses available publicly. The user interacts with the Database through HTTP requests, passing and retrieving data as JSON format. The user needs to have credentials to create, update and delete courses. The applications also use Sequelize validations to make sure of the required inputs are filled.
